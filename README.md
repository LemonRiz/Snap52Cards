# Snap52Cards
Modelling the card game snap using the Java language. This is a project for the _Nology training course.


The user can generate a deck of 52 cards, and draw cards one at a time. There are options for how to shuffle the deck, with shuffle being the most relevant for the game.

If the symbol on the dealt card is the same, the user can type "Snap" to win the game. 

If all of the cards are drawn, the deck will refresh and be created again.
